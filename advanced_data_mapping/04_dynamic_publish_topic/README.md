# Dynamic Publish Topics

**Purpose**: Learn how to create dynamic publish topics using data from input topics names and payloads
**Key Concepts**: Wildcard variables, setContextVars rule, dynamic topic construction

## Overview

Dynamic publish topics allow you to create output topics that are constructed from:
- **Wildcard segments** from the input topic pattern
- **Payload data** using the setContextVars rule
- **Combinations** of both approaches for complex routing

## When to Use Dynamic Publish Topics

**Perfect Use Cases:**
- **Multi-tenant systems**: Route messages to tenant-specific topics
- **Device-specific routing**: Send data to device-specific endpoints
- **Hierarchical data organization**: Build topic trees based on data content
- **Dynamic system integration**: Route to different systems based on payload content
- **UNS (Unified Namespace)**: Transform legacy systems into standardized enterprise hierarchies

## Folder Structure

### [wildcards/](wildcards/)
Learn how to use wildcard segments from input topics to construct dynamic publish topics:
- Extract location, device, or system identifiers from topic paths
- Build hierarchical output topics using wildcard values
- Route messages based on topic structure

### [set_context_vars/](set_context_vars/)
Learn how to use payload data to create dynamic publish topics:
- Extract routing information from message payloads
- Use setContextVars rule to prepare dynamic values
- Build complex topic paths from payload content

## Comparison: Wildcards vs SetContextVars

| Approach | Data Source | Use Case | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| **Wildcards** | Topic segments | Route by topic structure | `input: sensors/{room}/temp` â†’ `output: alerts/{room}/high` |
| **SetContextVars** | Payload content | Route by data content | `payload: {"priority": "high"}` â†’ `output: alerts/high/notification` |
| **Combined** | Both sources | Complex routing logic | Topic + payload â†’ `output: {tenant}/{priority}/{device}` |
| **UNS Implementation** | Topic structure | Legacy to standardized hierarchy | `legacy/{site}/{line}/data` â†’ `UNS/Enterprise/{site}/Line/{line}` |

## Key Benefits

âœ… **Flexible Routing**: Send messages to different destinations based on content
âœ… **System Integration**: Route to different systems or services dynamically  
âœ… **Multi-tenancy**: Separate data streams by tenant, user, or organization
âœ… **Conditional Logic**: Apply business rules to determine routing
âœ… **Scalability**: Handle dynamic systems without hardcoded topic mappings
âœ… **UNS Compliance**: Transform legacy topic structures into ISA-95 compliant hierarchies

## Getting Started

1. **Start with [wildcards/](wildcards/)** if you need to route based on topic structure
2. **Try [set_context_vars/](set_context_vars/)** if you need to route based on payload content
3. **Combine both** for advanced routing scenarios

Each folder contains working examples with detailed explanations and real-world use cases.

## ðŸ’¡ UNS (Unified Namespace) Implementation Hint

**UNS transforms disparate enterprise systems into a single, standardized topic hierarchy.** Dynamic publish topics are **essential** for UNS because:

### Why UNS Needs Dynamic Publishing
- **Legacy Integration**: Transform `legacy/plant-01/line-a/data` â†’ `UNS/Enterprise/plant-01/Area/production/Line/line-a`
- **ISA-95 Compliance**: Automatically structure topics according to enterprise hierarchy standards
- **Semantic Consistency**: Extract business meaning from legacy topics and map to standardized paths

### UNS Pattern Examples
```yaml
# Legacy System â†’ UNS Transformation
Input:  legacy/+site/+area/+line/+asset/data
Output: UNS/Enterprise/{site}/Area/{area}/Line/{line}/Asset/{asset}

# Multi-Protocol UNS
Input:  protocols/+protocol/+device/+datapoint
Output: UNS/Systems/{protocol}/Devices/{device}/DataPoints/{datapoint}
```
