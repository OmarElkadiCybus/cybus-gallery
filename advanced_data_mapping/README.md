## Detailed Folder Descriptions

### üìÅ [01_array/](./01_array/) - Array Subscription Fundamentals
**Complexity**: ‚≠ê Basic | **Focus**: Explicit topic control with different structures

Learn the foundation of multi-topic mapping using array subscriptions. Perfect for:
- **Mixed System Integration**: Combine data from `factory/machines`, `building/sensors`, `vehicle/telemetry`
- **Protocol Flexibility**: Handle MQTT topics alongside simulated OPC UA and HTTP endpoints
- **Precise Source Control**: Explicitly define each topic with custom labels
- **Enterprise Basics**: Foundation for complex industrial data integration

**Key Learning**: How collect rules create key-value caches from multiple sources and why proper JSONata syntax (`$lookup()`) is essential for accessing cached data.

### üìÅ [02_wildcards/](./02_wildcards/) - Wildcard Pattern Matching  
**Complexity**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê Intermediate | **Focus**: Automatic topic discovery and context variables

Master wildcard-based topic subscriptions for scalable, pattern-driven data collection:
- **Hierarchical Data**: Handle `building/+floor/+room/+sensor` patterns automatically
- **Context Variables**: Extract wildcard values using `$context.vars.{name}` for transforms
- **Scalable Discovery**: Automatically process new topics matching patterns
- **Device Fleet Management**: Monitor `devices/+type/+id/status` across entire fleets

**Key Learning**: How wildcard names create context variables and the difference between MQTT wildcards (`+`, `#`) and topic dynamic labels.

### üìÅ [03_wildcards_with_collect/](./03_wildcards_with_collect/) - Advanced Wildcard Aggregation
**Complexity**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Advanced | **Focus**: Cross-correlation and dynamic label strategies

Combine wildcard patterns with collect rules for sophisticated data aggregation and analytics:
- **Cross-Domain Intelligence**: Integrate `factory/+line/status`, `maintenance/+equipment/schedule`, `quality/+batch/results`
- **Dynamic Label Prevention**: Avoid data loss with semantic labeling (`prod_{line}`, `maint_{equipment}`)
- **Enterprise Analytics**: Build manufacturing execution systems with real-time correlation
- **Statistical Processing**: Calculate averages, detect outliers, and trend analysis across topic sets

**Key Learning**: Why dynamic labels are critical for preventing data overwrite in collect caches and advanced JSONata patterns for enterprise-scale data processing.

### üìÅ [04_dynamic_publish_topic/](./04_dynamic_publish_topic/) - Content-Based Routing & UNS
**Complexity**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Expert | **Focus**: Dynamic routing and Unified Namespace implementation

Master advanced routing techniques and enterprise standardization:

#### üîÄ **[wildcards/](./04_dynamic_publish_topic/wildcards/)** - Topic Structure Routing
Route messages based on input topic structure using wildcard variables:
- **Multi-Tenant SaaS**: `saas/{tenant}/{service}/events` ‚Üí `analytics/{tenant}/services/{service}/processed`
- **Building Automation**: `sensors/{room}/{sensor}/data` ‚Üí `alerts/{room}/{sensor}/status`
- **UNS Transformation**: `legacy/{site}/{line}/data` ‚Üí `UNS/Enterprise/{site}/Line/{line}`
- **ISA-95 Compliance**: Transform legacy systems into standardized enterprise hierarchies

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **[set_context_vars/](./04_dynamic_publish_topic/set_context_vars/)** - Payload-Based Routing
Route messages based on payload content using setContextVars rule:
- **Alert Prioritization**: Route by `$.priority` to `alerts/{tenant}/{priority}/notifications`
- **Business Logic**: `$.order.amount > 1000` ‚Üí `processing/enterprise/urgent/orders`
- **IoT Device Health**: Route by device status to `devices/{type}/{location}/{health}/data`
- **Conditional Routing**: Apply complex business rules for dynamic destination selection

**Key Learning**: UNS (Unified Namespace) implementation patterns, setContextVars syntax with `vars:` property, and enterprise-grade routing strategies for multi-tenant systems.

## Quick Decision Guide

**üéØ Use Arrays When:**
- Topics have **different roots**: `factory/machine`, `car/sensor`, `building/hvac`
- Mixing **different endpoints**: MQTT + OPC UA + HTTP
- Need **precise control** over specific sources
- **Learning foundation** mapping concepts

**üîç Use Wildcards When:**
- Topics share **common root**: `building/+floor/+room/temperature`
- Want **automatic discovery** of matching topics
- All sources are **MQTT topics**
- **Scalable device fleets** or hierarchical systems

**üìä Use Wildcards + Collect When:**
- Need **cross-correlation** between related topics
- Building **analytics and dashboards**
- **Enterprise integration** across multiple systems
- **Manufacturing execution** or process monitoring

**üöÄ Use Dynamic Publish Topics When:**
- **Multi-tenant systems** requiring isolation
- **Content-based routing** and business logic
- **UNS (Unified Namespace)** standardization
- **Legacy system modernization**

# Example: Mixed approach in one service
mappings:
- subscribe:  # Array for different systems
    - topic: factory/production/+line/status
      label: 'prod_{line}'
    - topic: maintenance/+equipment/schedule  
      label: 'maint_{equipment}'
  publish:
    topic: 'integrated/{line}/status'  # Dynamic publishing
  rules:
  - collect: {}  # Collect for correlation
  - setContextVars:  # Content-based routing
      vars:
        line: $.production_line_id
  - transform: { ... }
```
