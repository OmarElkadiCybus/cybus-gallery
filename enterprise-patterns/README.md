| **[Wildcards + Collect](./multi-topic-mapping/03_wildcards_with_collect/)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Expert | Cross-correlation, analytics | Enterprise integration, MES systems |
| **[Dynamic Publishing](./multi-topic-mapping/04_dynamic_publish_topic/)** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Expert | Content-based routing, UNS | Multi-tenant, business logic routing |

**🎯 Featured Examples:**
- **[Factory Line Analytics](./multi-topic-mapping/03_wildcards_with_collect/02_array_of_topics_patterns/)** - Cross-domain production correlation
- **[UNS Implementation](./multi-topic-mapping/04_dynamic_publish_topic/)** - Enterprise namespace transformation
- **[Multi-Tenant Routing](./multi-topic-mapping/04_dynamic_publish_topic/set_context_vars/)** - Content-based message routing

## 🏗️ Enterprise Architecture Patterns

### **Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES)**
- **Production Line Integration** - Coordinate equipment, quality, and maintenance data
- **Cross-Domain Analytics** - Correlate production, quality, and maintenance metrics
- **Real-Time Dashboards** - Aggregate KPIs from multiple production areas
- **Batch Tracking** - Follow products through multi-stage manufacturing processes

### **Unified Namespace (UNS) Implementation**
- **Legacy System Integration** - Transform proprietary formats to standard schemas
- **ISA-95 Compliance** - Map data to standard industrial hierarchies
- **Enterprise Data Standards** - Implement consistent naming and structure
- **Multi-Site Coordination** - Standardize data across global facilities

### **Multi-Tenant SaaS Platforms**
- **Content-Based Routing** - Route messages based on payload content
- **Dynamic Topic Generation** - Create topics based on business logic
- **Tenant Isolation** - Secure data separation for different customers
- **Scalable Device Management** - Handle thousands of devices per tenant

## 🚀 Recommended Learning Path

### **Prerequisites** 📚
**Complete [Fundamentals](../fundamentals/) first!** You'll need solid understanding of:
- Data processing rules (transform, filter, collect, stash)
- JSONata expressions and rule chains
- Basic MQTT topic structures

### **Phase 1: Multi-System Integration** ⭐⭐ Intermediate
1. **[Array Mapping](./multi-topic-mapping/01_array/)** - Learn to integrate different systems
2. **[Wildcard Patterns](./multi-topic-mapping/02_wildcards/)** - Scale with pattern-based discovery

### **Phase 2: Enterprise Analytics** ⭐⭐⭐ Advanced  
3. **[Wildcards + Collect](./multi-topic-mapping/03_wildcards_with_collect/)** - Master cross-domain correlation
4. **Advanced JSONata** - Complex expressions for enterprise data processing

### **Phase 3: Dynamic Architectures** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Expert
5. **[Dynamic Publishing](./multi-topic-mapping/04_dynamic_publish_topic/)** - Implement content-based routing
6. **UNS Transformation** - Convert legacy systems to unified namespace
7. **Multi-Tenant Patterns** - Build scalable SaaS architectures
