# Data Processing

Transform, filter, and route your industrial data with Cybus Connectware.

## Data Processing Rules

### Core Rules
- **[Transform Rules](./01_transform/)** - Convert and manipulate data formats
- **[Filter Rules](./02_filter/)** - Conditionally process messages
- **[Parse Rules](./03_parse/)** - Extract data from strings and complex formats
- **[Stash Rules](./04_stash/)** - Store and retrieve state between messages
- **[Collect Rules](./07_collect/)** - Aggregate data from multiple sources
- **[Set Context Variables](./05_setContextVars/)** - Manage dynamic configuration
- **[Change of Value (COV)](./06_cov/)** - Detect and process data changes
- **[Burst Rules](./08_burst/)** - Split single messages into multiple outputs
- **[Complete Rule Chain](./complete_rule_chain_example.scf.yaml)** - See all rules working together

### Advanced Patterns
For advanced mapping patterns including arrays, wildcards, and dynamic routing, see the **[Advanced Mapping Examples](../advanced-mapping/)** section.
