# Advanced Mapping Patterns

**Purpose**: Master advanced Cybus Connectware mapping techniques for enterprise-scale Industrial IoT systems
**Focus**: Multi-topic patterns, wildcards, and dynamic routing

## Overview

This section covers sophisticated mapping patterns that go beyond basic single-topic transformations. Learn how to handle complex enterprise scenarios involving multiple data sources, dynamic routing, and advanced aggregation patterns.

> **üí° Internal Topics & Security**: When Connectware creates endpoints, it automatically publishes data to internal MQTT topics prefixed with `${Cybus::MqttRoot}`. This prefix ensures data isolation and security between different Connectware services.

### Understanding `${Cybus::MqttRoot}` with Manufacturing Examples

**Why Internal Topics Matter:**
When you create endpoints (OPC UA, Modbus, HTTP), Connectware publishes their data to internal MQTT topics that are isolated from external MQTT traffic. Your mappings must subscribe to these internal topics to process the endpoint data.

**‚ùå Wrong - External Topic Pattern:**
```yaml
# This WON'T receive data from your endpoints!
subscribe:
  topic: production/lines/line-a/status  # Missing ${Cybus::MqttRoot}
```

**‚úÖ Correct - Internal Topic Pattern:**
```yaml
# This WILL receive data from your endpoints
subscribe:
  topic: ${Cybus::MqttRoot}/production/lines/line-a/status  # Includes prefix
```

**Complete Manufacturing Example:**
```yaml
resources:
  # OPC UA Endpoint publishes to internal topic
  lineAStatusEndpoint:
    type: Cybus::Endpoint
    properties:
      protocol: Opcua
      connection: !ref opcuaConnection
      subscribe:
        nodeId: "ns=2;s=ProductionLine.A.Status"
      topic: production/lines/line-a/status  # Internal topic (auto-prefixed)

  # Mapping must subscribe to internal topic with prefix
  productionAnalytics:
    type: Cybus::Mapping
    properties:
      mappings:
      - subscribe:
          topic: ${Cybus::MqttRoot}/production/lines/line-a/status  # ‚úÖ Correct
        publish:
          topic: analytics/production/line-a/performance  # ‚úÖ External (no prefix)
        rules:
        - transform:
            expression: |
              {
                "line_id": "line-a",
                "oee": $.oee,
                "timestamp": $now()
              }
```

**Key Points:**
- üîí **Endpoints publish internally**: Data goes to `${Cybus::MqttRoot}/your/topic`
- üì• **Mappings subscribe internally**: Use `${Cybus::MqttRoot}/your/topic` in subscribe
- üì§ **Mappings publish externally**: Use `your/topic` (no prefix) in publish
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security isolation**: Internal topics are isolated between services

## Internal Topics in Advanced Patterns

All advanced mapping patterns demonstrate proper `${Cybus::MqttRoot}` usage:

**üîß Wildcards with Internal Topics:**
```yaml
# Multiple production lines - all use internal topic prefix
subscribe:
  topic: ${Cybus::MqttRoot}/production/lines/+line/status
# Matches: ${Cybus::MqttRoot}/production/lines/line-a/status
#         ${Cybus::MqttRoot}/production/lines/line-b/status
```

**üéØ Array Mapping with Mixed Sources:**
```yaml
# Different systems - all internal topics
subscribe:
  - topic: ${Cybus::MqttRoot}/production/lines/+line/oee     # OPC UA endpoint
  - topic: ${Cybus::MqttRoot}/quality/zones/+zone/results   # Modbus endpoint  
  - topic: ${Cybus::MqttRoot}/energy/meters/+meter/usage    # HTTP endpoint
```

**üìä Collect Rules with Internal Topics:**
```yaml
# Aggregation across internal endpoint data
subscribe:
  topic: ${Cybus::MqttRoot}/machines/+machine/health
  label: 'machine_{machine}'
rules:
- collect: {}  # Collects all internal machine data
```

**üöÄ Dynamic Routing from Internal to External:**
```yaml
# Route from internal endpoint data to external topics
subscribe:
  topic: ${Cybus::MqttRoot}/alerts/+department/+priority
publish:
  topic: 'notifications/{department}/{priority}/teams'  # External (no prefix)
```

## Quick Decision Guide

**üîß Choose Basic Wildcards ([01_basic_wildcards/](./01_basic_wildcards/)) When:**
- Topics **share root structure**: `sensors/+room/+type` or `devices/+location/+id`
- Need **simple dynamic handling** without complex aggregation
- **Getting started** with wildcard patterns

**üéØ Choose Array Mapping ([02_array/](./02_array/)) When:**
- Topics have **completely different roots**: `factory/line` vs `building/hvac` vs `vehicle/engine`
- **Mixed endpoint types**: MQTT + OPC UA + HTTP in same service
- **Enterprise integration**: Combining disparate business systems

**üìä Choose Wildcards + Collect ([03_wildcards_with_collect/](./03_wildcards_with_collect/)) When:**
- Need **data aggregation** across wildcard matches
- **Cross-correlation analytics**: Compare data from multiple similar sources
- **Statistical processing**: Averages, ranges, outlier detection across topic sets

**üöÄ Choose Dynamic Publishing ([04_dynamic_publish_topic/](./04_dynamic_publish_topic/)) When:**
- **Routing requirements**: Messages need different destinations based on content
- **Multi-tenant architecture**: Separate data streams by tenant or service
- **UNS transformation**: Converting legacy systems to standardized hierarchies
